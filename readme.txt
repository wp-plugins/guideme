Create handy tips for your admins.

== Description ==

GuideMe is a simple and easy to use plugin that allows you to create helpful tips for site admins.

You can select any post types or taxonomies to create help messages. 

To create a tip, simply drag a pin to the page element that needs to be described.  After you add a help text and save it, you can see it on the front-end of the site. These tips are visible only to site administrators who are logged in to wp-admin. 

Each page can have unlimited hints, so you can provide the necessary amount of help information for each and every customer.
