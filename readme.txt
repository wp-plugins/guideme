== Description ==

<a href="http://psd2html.com/guideme">GuideMe</a> is a simple and easy to use plugin that allows you to create helpful tips for site admins.

You can select any post types or taxonomies to create help messages. 

To create a tip, simply drag a pin to the page element that needs to be described.  After you add a help text and save it, you can see it on the front-end of the site. These tips are visible only to site administrators who are logged in to wp-admin.
